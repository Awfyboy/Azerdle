# Wordle-Zen

![wordle zen logo](/.media/thumbnails/thumbnail.png)

Wordle: a game where you guess 5-letter words in 6 tries.
This is a Godot v4.3 experiment project. This project contains:
- Reading words from a word file and storing words to an Array,
- Determining matches for each letter and confirming correct guesses similar to Wordle,
- Multiple resolution support using Godot Control nodes, anchors and viewport settings,
- Setup for Desktop, Mobile and Web (with Web being the target platform),
- Setup with custom virtual keyboard,
- Use of AudioStreamRandomiser to play random sounds at random pitches,
- Use of Tweens and AnimationPlayer,
- SignalBus as a singleton for global signal communication.

Feel free to add more words to the list as I have to add some words manually.
